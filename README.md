Overview of the project 

The provided Python program acts as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Components:

calculate function: This function takes three arguments: two numbers (num1 and num2) and an operator (operator). Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and returns the result. It also includes error handling to catch division by zero and invalid operators.

Main Loop: The program enters a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit. Inside the loop:

User Input (Number 1): The program prompts the user to enter the first number. It uses a try-except block to handle potential ValueError if the user enters something other than a number.
Operator Selection: The program prompts the user to choose an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
User Input (Number 2): Similar to the first number, the program prompts for the second number with error handling for invalid input.
Calculation & Display: The program calls the calculate function with the obtained numbers and operator. If the calculation is successful (no errors), it displays the result in a formatted string.
Exit Option: The program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the user enters anything other than 'y' (case-insensitive), the loop breaks, and the program exits.

Overall Functionality:

The program provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.
It ensures valid number and operator inputs through error handling.
The loop allows users to perform multiple calculations consecutively without restarting the program.

Enhancements:

The program can be extended to include additional functionalities like calculating percentages or exponents.
More comprehensive error handling can be implemented to catch other potential input errors.
